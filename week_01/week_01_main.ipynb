    "# Introduction to Working with Large Language Models\n",
    "### Today's goals are:\n",
    "- Learn the basics of interacting with LLMs\n",
    "- Explore LLMs that can consume other modalities beyond text, e.g., images\n",
    "- Evaluate an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Interacting with LLMs\n",
    "Since LLMs are language models, we primarily interact with them using language vis a vis \"prompts.\" These interactions typically involve the following steps:\n",
    "1. **System Prompt** - Provides the LLM with some context for how it should \"think\" about the task at hand\n",
    "2. **User Prompt** - Instructs the LLM to carry out a task\n",
    "3. **Assisstant Response** - The output of the LLM in response to the system and user prompts\n",
    "4. Further Interactions - Steps 2 and 3 can be repeated to form a \"conversation\"\n",
    "The quality of the output from an LLM depends highly on how we prompt it--as we will see later in the lab. \n",

    "#### Our First Conversation\n",
    "Let's use the HuggingFace (ðŸ¤—) Transformers library to experiment with one of Meta's latest models."

      "\n",
      "That being said, here are some points to consider when rebalancing your portfolio:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros of adding tech stocks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diversification**: Tech stocks can provide a relatively stable and growing industry, which can help diversify your portfolio and reduce exposure to volatile sectors like oil and gas.\n",
      "2. **Growth potential**: Tech companies often have strong growth potential, which can lead to higher returns over the long term.\n",
      "3. **Inflation hedge**: Tech stocks can be a good hedge against inflation, as they often have low production costs and can benefit from increased demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons of adding tech stocks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Risk**: Tech stocks can be highly volatile, and large price swings can result in significant losses if not managed properly.\n",
      "2. **Overexposure**: If you're not careful, you might overexpose your portfolio to tech stocks, which can lead to decreased diversification and reduced long-term returns.\n",
      "3. **Market saturation**: The tech industry is highly competitive, and some sectors may be saturated, which can lead to decreased growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons of removing oil and gas stocks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Risk**: Oil and gas stocks can be highly volatile, and large price swings can result in significant losses if not managed properly.\n",
      "2. **Diversification**: Removing oil and gas stocks from your portfolio can lead to decreased diversification and reduced long-term returns.\n",
      "3. **Industry disruption**: The oil and gas industry is facing significant disruption from alternative energy sources, which can lead to decreased demand and reduced growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Portfolio rebalancing strategy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assess your risk tolerance**: Consider your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. If you're conservative, you may want to prioritize more stable sectors like tech and remove oil and gas stocks.\n",
      "2. **Diversification**: Make sure your portfolio is diversified across different sectors and asset classes. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy or electric vehicles.\n",
      "3. **Rebalance regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Direct investment advice:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tech stocks**: Invest in companies like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon, which have strong growth potential and a relatively stable industry.\n",
      "2. **Alternative energy**: Invest in companies like Tesla, Vestas, and Enel Green Power, which have a strong presence in the renewable energy sector.\n",
      "3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different sectors and asset classes to minimize risk and maximize returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please keep in mind that this is general advice, and I'm not a licensed financial advisor. It's essential to consult with a professional before making significant changes to your portfolio.\n"
